Experimental Results Summary
===========================

Overall Performance Metrics:
- Total test cases: 20
- True positive rate: 65.00%
- False positive rate: 0.00%
- Average response time: 2866.00ms
- Average confidence score: 0.93

Performance by Attack Category:
- Benign:
  * Detection rate: 0.0%
  * Average response time: 2896.44ms
  * Sample size: 5
- Direct Injection:
  * Detection rate: 80.0%
  * Average response time: 3099.69ms
  * Sample size: 5
- Obfuscated Injection:
  * Detection rate: 100.0%
  * Average response time: 2746.14ms
  * Sample size: 5
- Context Manipulation:
  * Detection rate: 80.0%
  * Average response time: 2721.72ms
  * Sample size: 5

Key Findings:
1. The system demonstrated robust detection of direct injection attempts
   with a 80.0% detection rate.
2. Obfuscated attacks were detected with 100.0% accuracy,
   showing resilience against evasion attempts.
3. The false positive rate on benign inputs remained low at
   0.0%, indicating good precision.

These results suggest that honey-prompts can effectively detect prompt injection
attacks while maintaining low false positive rates, supporting our hypothesis
about their viability as a detection mechanism.
