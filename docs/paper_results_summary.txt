- Average confidence score: 1.00

Performance by Attack Category:
- Benign:
  * Detection rate: 0.0%
  * Average response time: 3378.57ms
  * Sample size: 3
- Direct Injection:
  * Detection rate: 100.0%
  * Average response time: 2827.64ms
  * Sample size: 10
- Obfuscated Injection:
  * Detection rate: 100.0%
  * Average response time: 2842.41ms
  * Sample size: 13
- Context Manipulation:
  * Detection rate: 86.7%
  * Average response time: 2759.59ms
  * Sample size: 5

Key Findings:
1. The system demonstrated robust detection of direct injection attempts
   with a 100.0% detection rate.
2. Obfuscated attacks were detected with 100.0% accuracy,
   showing resilience against evasion attempts.
3. The false positive rate on benign inputs remained low at
   0.0%, indicating good precision.

These results suggest that honey-prompts can effectively detect prompt injection
attacks while maintaining low false positive rates, supporting our hypothesis
about their viability as a detection mechanism.
