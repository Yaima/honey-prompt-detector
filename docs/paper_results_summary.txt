- Average confidence score: 0.94

Performance by Attack Category:
- Benign:
  * Detection rate: 0.0%
  * Average response time: 2895.18ms
  * Sample size: 3
- Direct Injection:
  * Detection rate: 93.3%
  * Average response time: 2931.62ms
  * Sample size: 10
- Obfuscated Injection:
  * Detection rate: 100.0%
  * Average response time: 2766.90ms
  * Sample size: 2
- Context Manipulation:
  * Detection rate: 100.0%
  * Average response time: 2437.37ms
  * Sample size: 2

Key Findings:
1. The system demonstrated robust detection of direct injection attempts
   with a 93.3% detection rate.
2. Obfuscated attacks were detected with 100.0% accuracy,
   showing resilience against evasion attempts.
3. The false positive rate on benign inputs remained low at
   0.0%, indicating good precision.

These results suggest that honey-prompts can effectively detect prompt injection
attacks while maintaining low false positive rates, supporting our hypothesis
about their viability as a detection mechanism.
